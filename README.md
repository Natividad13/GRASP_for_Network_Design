# GRASP_for_Network_Design
Computational results collected from an experiment of a GRASP algorithm for a the covering network design problem of https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305054821001805
For this experiment we have used instances with 20, 40 and 60 nodes generated in a random manner. There are 20 underlying networks of each size.
The percentage of available budget is fixed to 0.4.

We show the average values of the differents variables taken into account (value of the demand convered, the overall execution time, the relative percent deviation with respect to the best solution found by a Benders decomposition routine)
